# HWRFR_PET

The folder named "main functions" contains all functions.

In the folder named "demo", "demo1.m" provides an example for implenmenting the functions in the 1D case; "demo2.m" provides an example for implenmenting the functions in the 3D case.

In the folder named "data", "example_1d" includes the data used in "demo1.m"; 

"image1.nii" and "image2.nii" are two sample images used in "demo2.m". "image3.nii" and "image4.nii" are copies of "image1.nii" and "image2.nii", only to create more data to do cross validation. (Which may not be a good idea.)

The "glmnet_matlab" folder is download from the website: https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/glmnet_matlab/.


Dr. Wang (Xuejing Wang from Umich) provided a majority part of the code. Thanks to Dr. Wang. 

As for the incomplete part in the code, I completed them according to my understanding of the work.
