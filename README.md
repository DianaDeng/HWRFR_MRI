Xuejing Wang, Bin Nan, Ji Zhu, Robert Koeppe & Kirk Frey

Preprocessing is completed in Jupyter. Please refer to the link https://jupyter.org/install.html to get started.

The folder named "main functions" contains all functions.

In the folder named "demo", "demo1.m" provides an example for implementing the functions in the 1D case; "demo2.m" provides an example for implementing the functions in the 3D case.

In the folder named "data", "example_1d" includes the data used in "demo1.m";
"image1.nii" and "image2.nii" are two sample images used in "demo2.m"；
"image3.nii" and "image4.nii" are copies of "image1.nii" and "image2.nii", only to create more data to do cross validation. (Which may not be a good idea.)

The "glmnet_matlab" folder is download from the website: 
https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/glmnet_matlab/.

Dr. Wang (Xuejing Wang from Umich) provided a majority part of the code. Thanks to Dr. Wang. 
As for the incomplete part in the code, Annan Deng completed them according to her understanding of the work.
